        "This case study describes a female immunocompromised individual with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia who became persistently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although asymptomatic throughout the course of infection, she demonstrated prolonged shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus and RNA. This study demonstrates that certain individuals may remain infectious for prolonged periods of time and highlights the need for further studies to understand risk factors for prolonged infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding.",

Instead, these viruses traffic to lysosomes for unconventional egress by Arl8b-dependent lysosomal exocytosis. Their non-lytic release results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation enzymes, and disruption of antigen presentation.",
