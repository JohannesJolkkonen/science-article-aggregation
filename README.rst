The site is available (for now) on science.johannesjolkkonen.com

Motivation
#############
This is a learning/showcase project I made mainly so that I could experiment with 
AWS' different options for app deployments, namely by using Docker, Elasticbeanstalk 
and Codepipeline. 

At the same time it was a nice way to learn about flask and some of the details in 
configuring a web server using httpd or nginx.
